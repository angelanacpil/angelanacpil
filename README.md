ðŸ‘‹ Hi, all! I'm Angela Nacpil. BSIT Student aspiring to become a Jr. Web Developer someday. 

I'm interested in all things web dev (love the front-end!), expanding my skill set, gaining valuable dev EXP and career opportunities!
Currently learning through tutorial videos, various bootcamps (udemy, freeCodeCamp, etc.), course work, and practice projects.
Still a beginner at the moment, but I'm willing to fail hard and learn--the hard way, too. No pain, no gain.
